== About KB4IT

=== Introduction

_KB4IT_ is a static website generator based on Asciidoctor sources
mainly for technical documentation purposes.

You can see some demos https://github.com/t00m/kb4it-adocs[here].

=== Motivations

* The main aim is to provide an easy way to write technical
documentation.
* Don't care about the formatting and focus on the contents.
* To allow teams to manage their knowledge database easily.
* Do not depend on third software products like word processors or
complex web applications.

=== Features

==== Pros

* Writing documentation: Documents must be in Asciidoctor format which
is easy to learn.
* Finding documents: Once a document is converted to html, properties
can be browsed. Moreover, property pages have filters and a search entry
to filter by title.
* Publishing your repository: all necessary files are inside a
directory. Browse it or copy it to your web server.
* Serverless: There is no need for a web server. Of course, you can use
one if you please.
* Smart compiling: Only those documents added or modified are compiled.

==== Cons

* No online editor: At this moment, KB4IT doesn't include any online
editor. You must create or edit your documents with your preferred
editor.
* No dynamic search: KB4IT was developed to be as simple as possible. No
dependencies at all excepting Asciidoctor (as text processor and
publishing toolchain) and Python (the programming language used).
