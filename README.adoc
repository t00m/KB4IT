== About KB4IT

=== Introduction

_KB4IT_ is a static website generator based on Asciidoctor sources
mainly for technical documentation purposes.

You can see some demos here: https://github.com/t00m/kb4it-adocs

=== Motivations

* The main aim is to provide an easy way to write my technical
documentation.
* Don't care about the formatting and focus on the contents.
* To allow teams to manage their knowledge database easily.
* Do not depend on third software products like word processors or
complex web applications.

=== Features

==== Pros

* Writing documentation: Documents must be in Asciidoctor format which
is easy to learn.
* Finding documents: Once a document is converted to html, properties
can be browsed. Moreover, property pages have filters and a search entry
to filter by title.
* Publishing your repository: all necessary files are inside a
directory. Browse it or copy it to your web server.
* Serverless: There is no need for a web server. Of course, you can use
one if you please.
* Smart compiling: Only those documents added or modified are compiled.
* Use the default themes or build your own custom theme
* By modifying templates, it might be integrated with Github or Gitlab.

==== Cons

* Not to much documentation at this moment
* No online editor: At this moment, KB4IT doesn't include any online
editor. You must create or edit your documents with your preferred
editor.
* No dynamic search: KB4IT was developed to be as simple as possible.
* No dependencies at all excepting Asciidoctor (as text processor and
publishing toolchain) and Python (the programming language used).
* API is not stable
* Most of the requirements are tailored to my own necessities which
might not be the same as yours.

=== Installation

==== From source

If you have used this app before, it might be necessary to uninstall it
before:

`pip3 uninstall kb4it -qy`

Then, install it:

`python3 setup.py install --user`

==== Pypi package

`pip3 install kb4it --user -U`

=== Execution

The most typical usage would be:

`$HOME/.local/bin/kb4it -source /path/to/asciidoctor/sources -target /path/to/target/directory -log DEBUG`

If templates remain the same, force a new compilation:

`$HOME/.local/bin/kb4it -source /path/to/asciidoctor/sources -target /path/to/target/directory --log DEBUG  -force`

If the directory containing the asciidoctor sources have a theme, it
will be used. However, you can specify one:

`$HOME/.local/bin/kb4it -source /path/to/asciidoctor/sources -target /path/to/target/directory -theme mytheme -log DEBUG`

You can also specify any_datetime_attribute to sort your documents:

`$HOME/.local/bin/kb4it -source /path/to/asciidoctor/sources -target /path/to/target/directory -sort Published -log DEBUG`
