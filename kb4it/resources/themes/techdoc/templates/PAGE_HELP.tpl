== Introduction

In this page you will learn:

* How to write a KB4IT document
* The most commonly used AsciiDoc syntax.


== KB4IT Documents

Taking as an example this page, a KB4IT document is made of two main parts:

. Header
. Body

=== Header

By using a first level section (`=`) you set the *title of the document*.

Then, enclosed by (`:`) you set its *properties*.

There are *six core properties* (Author, Category, Scope, Status, Priority and Team).

Moreover, you can add any property you imagine. There is no limits.

Finally, you must indicate the end of the header with this line:

`// END-OF-HEADER. DO NOT MODIFY OR DELETE THIS LINE`

=== Body

After you write the header, you can start writing your document.

Use the source code of other KB4IT pages as templates or write your own page from the scratch.

Bellow, you have some <<References,Asciidoc references>> for an extended documentation and a brief <<Cheatsheet,Asciidoc cheatsheet>>.
