# Introduction

**KB4IT** helps you to build a static website with all your procedures and documents

It is based on [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org) markdown.

Main goals:

*   Easy to write technical documentation
*   Easy to find documentation
*   Easy to publish documentation
*   Easy to backup/restore documentation

# How it works

This is the flow:

1.  Delete contents of target directory (if any)
2.  Get source documents
3.  Preprocess documents (get metadata)
4.  Process documents in a temporary dir
5.  Compile documents to html with asciidoc
6.  Copy all documents to target path
7.  Copy source docs to target directory


# Execution

kb4it is a Python3 script. All parameters are optional except the source directory.

The most typical usage would be:

    python3 kb4it.py -sp /path/to/source/docs -tp /var/www/html/repo -v ERROR

Display help by passing -h as argument:

```
usage: kb4it.py [-h] [-sp SOURCE_PATH] [-tp TARGET_PATH] [-v LOGLEVEL [DEBUG|INFO|ERROR]]
                [--version]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -sp SOURCE_PATH, --source-path SOURCE_PATH
                        Path for Asciidoc source files.
  -tp TARGET_PATH, --target-path TARGET_PATH
                        Path for output files
  -v LOGLEVEL, --verbosity LOGLEVEL
                        Increase output verbosity
  --version             show program's version number and exit
```

# Notes

* Target directories are created if they do not exist.
* Source directory is never touched. Source documents are copied to a temporary directory
* Contents on target directory are always deleted before compilation
