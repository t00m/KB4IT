== Introduction
Sometimes, _db2stop_ command cannot stop the database and it returns the following message:

----
The database manager was not stopped because databases are still active.
----


== Procedure


=== Check running applications

Login as db2<sid> and execute the following commands:

`db2 list application show detail`

=== Stop database
Stop all of them:

`db2 force application all` followed by `db2stop`

Then, check if there are still DB2 processes:

`ps -ef | grep db2crt`

If any, kill'em all with the `kill` command.

== Notes about this procedure

WARNING: This procedure is very *dangerous*. Try to avoid it.
